This application selects randomly an English word, one after another, from the english_words.csv file. Then it shows the solution after a 3 seconds, which is the Hungarian equivalent of the word.

If you know the solution, you could check the chekcmark but if you don't you should press on the cross image.

With this method you could seperate the words that you know and after the first running of the code the results of known and unknown words will be saved into two different csv files.

The second time you run the code it will use the saved unknown_words.csv file instead of the english_words.csv. This problem among others solved by error and exception handling.
